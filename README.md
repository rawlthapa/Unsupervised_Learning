# Unsupervised Learning Project

This project explores **unsupervised learning** techniques, focusing on **K-means clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. The goal is to identify patterns and simplify data visualization by reducing dimensions, making complex datasets easier to interpret.

## Project Overview

### Key Techniques
- **K-means Clustering**: A clustering algorithm that groups data points into K clusters based on feature similarity.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A dimensionality reduction technique that projects high-dimensional data into fewer dimensions while retaining essential patterns.

### Dataset
- The project utilizes the popular **Iris dataset** for demonstration purposes, with various features used for clustering and dimensionality reduction.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks with data exploration, K-means clustering, and PCA analysis.
- `data/`: (Optional) Dataset files if stored locally.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts used for clustering and PCA.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Installation

To run this project, install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
